# Background
- By exploiting vulnerabilities in the Linux Kernel we can sometimes escalate our privileges. What we usually need to know to test if a kernel exploit works is the OS, architecture and kernel version. 
- Don't use kernel exploits if you can avoid it. If you use it might crash the machine or put it in an unstable state. So kernel exploits should be the last resort.
- Always use a simpler priv-esc if you can. They can also produce a lot of stuff in the sys.log. So if you find anything good, put it up on your list and keep searching for other ways before exploiting it.

# Identify Distribution Type
```
cat /etc/issue 
cat/etc/*-release
```
- Good general hint no matter the OS flavor.
```
uname -a 
```
- Generic command for all LSB distros
```
lsb_release -d 
```
- Generic for distros using “systemd” 
```
/etc/os-release 
```
- Generic but often modified 
```
/etc/issue 
cat /etc/*release 
```
- Novell SUSE 
```
/etc/SUSE-release 
```
- Red Hat 
```
/etc/redhat-release
/etc/redhat_version 
```
- Fedora
```
/etc/fedora-release 
```
- Slackware
```
/etc/slackware-release
/etc/slackware-version 
```
- Debian
```
/etc/debian_release
/etc/debian_version 
cat/etc/lsb-release  
```
- Mandrake
```
/etc/mandrake-release 
```
- Sun JDS
```
/etc/sun-release 
```
- Solaris/Sparc
```
/etc/release 
```
- Gentoo
```
/etc/gentoo-release 
```
- Arch Linux (file will be empty) 
```
/etc/arch-release 
```
- OpenBSD; sample: “OpenBSD.amd64” 
```
arch 
```

# Kernal Version
```
uname -a 
uname -mrs 
cat /proc/version 
rpm -q kernel 
dmesg | grep Linux 
ls /boot | grep vmlinuz- 
```
