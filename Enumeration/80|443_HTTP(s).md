# Inspect HTML Code of Webpapges
- Should be done on each page you are able to navigate to.
- Focus on where there are any usernames / passwords, comments / notes, extraneous / non-prod code, or hidden values in the HTML.

# Evaluate IP vs. Hostname Resolution
- Sometimes hostname-based routing is applied in the web server service in which you get different results if you navigate to port 80 with the IP or the hostname. 
- Try both IP and Hostname to see if this is the case to capture all enumeration possibilities. 
1. Identify the hostname of the box – generally through the 'CommonName' field of the SSL cert for web pages with HTTPS running (generally over port 443). 
2. Add the mapping between IP and hostname into the attacker machine host file. 
```
vi /etc/hosts/
[IP address]         [hostname] 
```
3. Access the webpage through the IP address over both port 80 and 443. 
4. Access the webpage through the host name over both port 80 and 443. 
- If they both result in the same page, then there is no hostname-based routing applicable.

# Evaluate HTTP/S Usage
- Generally HTTP works over port 80 and HTTPS works over port 443.  However, this isn't always the case.  Sometimes there is different content served over different protocols through either of these ports. 
1. Access port 80 over HTTP and HTTPS protocols. 
2. Access port 443 over HTTP and HTTPS protocols

# Evaluate SSL Cert Details
- Sites that allow SSL/TLS over HTTPS have a Public Certificate that is viewable by all clients. 
1. Navigate to the webpage using the HTTPS protocol. 
2. Click on the lock in the address bar. 
3. More Information > Security > View Certificate > Details 
4. Hostname > Certificate > Issuer 
  - Email address with a username in the 'E' field. 
  - Hostname in the 'CN' field. 
5. Hostname > Certificate > Subject 
  - Email address with a username in the 'E' field. 
  - Hostname in the 'CN' field.

# Web Directory Enumeration
```
gobuster -u http(s)://[IP Address / Hostname] -w [wordlist location options below] –o [output file location] -k 
```

# OS Fingerprinting
Works best with Apache web servers as there are specific versions for different flavors of *nix.
1. Get the web server service version from an Nmap service scan.
2. Google / use launchpad.net to identify the *nix OS version that works with the web server version.

# Content Management Systems (CMS) Enumeration

## CMS Explorer
Used for initial fingerprinting of what CMS are used on the site.
```
cms-explorer -url http://INSERTIPADDRESS -type [Drupal, WordPress, Joomla, Mambo]
```

## Wordpress
```
wpscan --url http://INSERTIPADDRESS --enumerate vp 
wpscan --url http://INSERTIPADDRESS --enumerate vt 
wpscan --url http://INSERTIPADDRESS --enumerate u
```
- vp: Vulnerable Plugins
- vt: Vulnerable Themes
- u: Users

## Joomscan
```
joomscan -u  http://INSERTIPADDRESS --enumerate-components
```

# Manual Method Testing
- Used to understand what methods are allowed and not allowed.
- This is generally taken care of by basic Nmap script scanning of HTTP(s) pages.
```
nc [IP] [port]
HEAD / HTTP/1.0  
OPTIONS / HTTP/1.0  
PROPFIND / HTTP/1.0  
TRACE / HTTP/1.1  
PUT http://[Target_URL]/[FILE_NAME]
POST http://[Target_URL]/[FILE_NAME] HTTP/1.x  
```
