# Background
- Network File Share. 
- This is a service used so that people can access certain parts of a remote filesystem. If this is badly configured it could mean that you grant excessive access to users. 
- You mount the NFS folder onto a local folder of your machine to interact with it. 
- The /etc/exports file on the NFS share lists the different share volumes available for mounting to other computers as well as configuration settings like root Squashing.

# Enumeration
1. Check to see what the filesystem is sharing through this service.
```
showmount -e [IP]
```
2. Mount the NFS to your attacker machine.
```
mount -t nfs [IP]:/ /[attacker file system location]
```
