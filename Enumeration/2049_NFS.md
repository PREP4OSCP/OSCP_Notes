# Background
- Network File Share. 
- This is a service used so that people can access certain parts of a remote filesystem. If this is badly configured it could mean that you grant excessive access to users. 
- You mount the NFS folder onto a local folder of your machine to interact with it. 
- The /etc/exports file on the NFS share lists the different share volumes available for mounting to other computers as well as configuration settings like root Squashing.

# Enumeration (Vulnhub:Vulnix)
1. Check to see what the filesystem is sharing through this service.
```
showmount -e [IP]
```
2. Create a directory location to mount the NFS file system to your box.
```
mkdir -p /[file location]/nfs
```
3. Mount the NFS to your attacker machine at the designated NFS mounting location.
```
mount -t nfs [IP]:/[target file system from #1] [attacker file system NFS location from #2] -nolock.
```
  Example
  ```
  mount -t nfs 10.10.10.12:/home/vulnix /root/Boxes/Vulnix/Exploits/nfs -nolock
  ```
4. Try to access the NFS mount at the location you created in #2 on your local box.  If you're unable to access this location, then the target has correctly enabled [root_squashing](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/security_guide/sect-security_guide-securing_nfs-do_not_use_the_no_root_squash_option) so that we can't read the contents.
