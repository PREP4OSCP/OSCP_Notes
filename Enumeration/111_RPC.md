# Background
- Remote Procedural Call (RPC) is a service that allows other computers to call on the host computer for some operation when executing a script or commands automatically.
- The existence of this port / service running usually indicates that there are other ports open on the machine (generally high-level ones running on non-standard ports).  You should do a full nmap scan of all ports if you see this port and service open.
- This can help look for Network File System (NFS) shares.

# Manual Enumeration
Obtain a list of services running with RPC Bind.
```
rpcbind -p [IP]
```
```
